Detailed documentation coming soon! For now, kindly visit the linked submodules to see the details of the server and client projects. 
See below for which branches to reference. 

## Client (frontend)
Checkout the `main` branch for a statically hosted frontend-only version of the project
Checkout the `FastAPI-DEV` branch for a version which makes calls to the custom FastAPI server hosted on DigitalOcean. 
This version of the frontend is not currently hosted and will require a local build.

## Server (backend)
Checkout the `main` branch for the most updated version of the server, including some integration tests.
